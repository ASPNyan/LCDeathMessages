LC Death Messages adds randomized Terraria-style death messages based on how you died, sent straight into chat for your
company to enjoy.

Featuring messages such as *"Player's incompetence was put on display"* or *"Player was bludgeoned out of their misery."*,
all death messages are based on Terraria and its creative death messages.

Jokes aside, this mod can provide at least some amount of useful information to your team, although they shouldn't need
this information because you shouldn't be dying ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

This mod is only required on the host machine, so adding it to your game is about as easy as it gets.

While I try (not so) hard to prevent bugs in my projects, they're bound to happen, and they don't surprise me (mostly).
If you do happen to find a bug, @ me in the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC) in a bug
report thread or something, I don't care, do what you want.
